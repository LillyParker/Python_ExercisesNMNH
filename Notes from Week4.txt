Python tutor website can help you visualize your code 
pythontutor.com 

"pass" you can pass through something elif i == /n: pass

Functions:
you can use or define your own function 

"modularize your code as much as possible"
break up into functions and call them

def <name function>  (arguments)

example:

def add_these(a,b):
	the_sum=a+b
	return the_sum

my_sum= add_these(1,5)

else:
	raise ValueError("some message that tells what the error is")
